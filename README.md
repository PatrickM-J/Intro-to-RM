# Intro to Research Methods

I am studying the topic of the use of English words in the Dutch language. Today, a lot of Dutch speakers tend to use or replace Dutch words with their English versions/variants, especially younger age groups. Therefore, I want to find out if there is a clear difference in the frequency of English words used by Dutch people in two different age groups. By researching this topic, I hope to be able to show how language use can differ between different age groups and how language can evolve due to the influence of another language.

For this research, I will be analyzing data from two different age groups: ages 16-30 and ages 30 and above. We will use a list of certain English words that Dutch people use very frequently in the Dutch language. Then, we will count the number of occurences of these English words to analyze the frequency of English words used. We use this method because for the English and Dutch language there are words that occur in both languages (for example, 'kind' has a Dutch version (Child) and an English version ('soort'). 

My hypothesis for my research is that there will be a significant
