# Intro to Research Methods

I am studying the topic of the use of English words in the Dutch language. Today, a lot of Dutch speakers tend to use or replace Dutch words with their English versions/variants, especially younger age groups. Therefore, I want to find out if there is a clear difference in the frequency of English words used by Dutch people in two different age groups. To investistage this, I will analyze tweets from Dutch users. By researching this topic, I hope to be able to show how language use can differ between different age groups and how language can evolve due to the influence of another language.

In earlier studies, they also analyzed the use of English words in Dutch language. For example, in a study by Gerritsen, Marinel, et al. (2000) they investigated how often Dutch commercials contained English language and whether consumers were able to understand the commercials. To determine whether a word was Dutch or English, they used the Dutch dictionary Van Dale. If a word was present in the dictionary, it was considered a Dutch word and if not, an English word. Furthermore, in a study by Smakman, Dick, et al. (2009), they investigated to what extend English words were used in Dutch radio commercials. They applied three criteria to determine the origin of words: 

1. If a word was found in the English dictionary, it was considered English
2. English words included proper names with a dictionary meaning
3. Words of English origin were not considered English if they were found in the most recent edition of the Dutch Van Dale dictionary
   

For this research, I will be analyzing data from two different age groups: ages 16-30 and ages 30 and above. We will use a corpus with tweets by Dutch users, where information such as their age is known. To determine if a certain word in a tweet is either Dutch or English, we will use the most recent edition of the Dutch Van Dale dictionary. If a word is found in the Van Dale dictionary it is considered Dutch, otherwise we consider it an English word. Then, we will analyze the frequency of English words by calculating the percentage of English and Dutch words used.

My hypothesis for my research is that there will be a significant difference in the frequency of English words between the two age groups. Specifically, I expect the younger age group (16-30) to use English words in their vocabulary more frequently compared to the older age group (30+).
